**Hi, I'm [Raghav](https://www.linkedin.com/in/21-raghav/)**

I thrive on crafting intuitive, efficient, and user-friendly interfaces. I have a solid foundation in React, including components, state management, and API integration. I'm continually sharpening my skills in advanced patterns and performance optimization. 

I embrace challenges as opportunities to learn, adapt, and grow. Whether collaborating with teams or tackling real-world projects. My goal is to contribute meaningfully while expanding my expertise in modern web development.
